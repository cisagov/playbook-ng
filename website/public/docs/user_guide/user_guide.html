<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to Playbook-NG! Playbook-NG is an application, developed by
CISA Threat Hunting, that is designed to facilitate the creation of
Countermeasure Playbooks through the usage of ATT&amp;CK-based
cybersecurity findings.</p>
<section id="intended-audience" class="level3">
<h3>1.1 Intended Audience</h3>
<p>The intended audience for Playbook-NG is cybersecurity professionals,
such as defensive cyber operations (DCO) engineers, who have some
familiarity with the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework along with related
concepts such as privilege escalation and persistence.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-a-playbook" class="level3">
<h3>1.2 What is a Playbook?</h3>
<p>A cybersecurity Playbook is a strategic document that outlines the
strategies or steps involved in combating a particular threat. For
example, Microsoft publishes its own set of <a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/operations/incident-response-playbooks">pre-built
Playbooks for dealing with threats such as Phishing</a>. Playbook-NG
allows users to create Playbooks that provide Countermeasures for one or
more ATT&amp;CK Techniques.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-a-countermeasure" class="level3">
<h3>1.3 What is a Countermeasure?</h3>
<p>In the context of Playbook-NG, we define a Countermeasure as an
action or procedure that reduces the vulnerability of an information
system to a particular attack. Therefore, Countermeasures are intended
to eliminate or mitigate the harm that can be caused by such
attacks.</p>
</section>
<section id="cisa-coun7er" class="level3">
<h3>1.4 CISA COUN7ER</h3>
<p>The CISA COUN7ER project is focused on creating an open-source
catalog of cybersecurity Countermeasures. Playbook-NG leverages the
COUN7ER dataset as its primary source of Countermeasures and includes
capabilities that allow for updating to the latest set of
Countermeasures from COUN7ER’s GitHub repository.</p>
<section id="contact-cisa" class="level4">
<h4>1.4.1 Contact CISA</h4>
<p>Contact CISA Central at 1-844-Say-CISA or SayCISA@cisa.dhs.gov for
questions about the tool.<br />

<h3>1.5 MITRE ATT&amp;CK</h3>
<p>The MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework is a knowledge base of adversary
Tactics and Techniques. ATT&amp;CK is used in Playbook-NG as a means of
defining a standard set of adversarial Techniques (e.g., LSASS memory
dumping) against which Countermeasure Playbooks can be built. Techniques
may come from cyber threat intelligence (CTI) or other sources such as
analyst knowledge. Resources for getting started with ATT&amp;CK can be
found <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/">here</a>.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="creating-a-playbook" class="level2">
<h2>2. Creating a Playbook</h2>
<p>There are three ways to create a Playbook in Playbook-NG:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start one from scratch</li>
<li>Create one based on a Template</li>
<li>Import an existing one</li>
</ol>
<section id="starting-from-scratch" class="level3">
<h3>2.1 Starting from Scratch</h3>
<p>To build a new Playbook from scratch, use the <strong>Start From
Scratch</strong> button on the Playbook-NG homepage.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/1_playbook_ng_home.jpg" style="width:600px;border: 3px solid #555" alt="The PlaybookNG Home Page"><br/><b>Figure
1: PlaybookNG Home Page</b>
</p>

<img src="./images/2_start_from_scratch.jpg" style="width:280px;border: 3px solid #555" alt="The Start a New Playbook Button (home page)"><br/><b>Figure
2: Start From Scratch Button</b>
</p>
<p>The <strong>Start From Scratch</strong> button creates a new, empty
Playbook and navigates to the Add ATT&amp;CK Techniques page, where the
ATT&amp;CK Techniques for the Playbook are selected. Refer to Section
3.1 for more information on adding ATT&amp;CK Techniques.</p>
</section>
<section id="creating-a-playbook-based-on-a-template" class="level3">
<h3>2.2 Creating a Playbook Based on a Template</h3>
<p>Besides starting from scratch, Playbook-NG also supports creating
Playbooks based on Templates. Templates are pre-built Playbooks centered
around providing Countermeasures against specific types of threats,
ranging from malware types such as Ransomware to specific threat actors
like Volt Typhoon. Therefore, Templates provide a set of ATT&amp;CK
Techniques and corresponding Countermeasures that can be used on their
own as a Playbook, or that can be updated with additional Techniques and
Countermeasures.</p>
<p>To create a Playbook based on a template, click on the <strong>Create
From a Template</strong> button on the Playbook-NG home page (see
<strong>Figure 3</strong>, below), which will navigate to the Templates
page.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/3_create_from_template.jpg" style="width:280px;border: 3px solid #555" alt="The Create from Template Button (home page)"><br/><b>Figure
3: Create Playbook from Template Button</b>
</p>
<section id="selecting-a-template" class="level4">
<h4>2.2.1 Selecting a Template</h4>
<p>The templates page provides a listing of the templates that are
currently available in Playbook-NG.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/4_templates_home.jpg" style="width:600px;border: 3px solid #555" alt="The Templates page"><br/><b>Figure
4: Templates Page (Example)</b>
</p>
<p>Clicking the <strong>More Info…</strong> button on a Template (see
<strong>Figure 4</strong>, above) will open a pop-up with a long-form
description covering the Template’s purpose and guidance on using it.
(When exporting a Playbook created from a Template - this description is
included at the start of Markdown / Microsoft Word outputs.)</p>
<p>Clicking the <strong>Select Template</strong> button on a Template
(see <strong>Figure 4</strong>, above) will start a new Playbook from
that Template. This opens the Playbook Review Page, which allows for
reviewing and deleting any unwanted Techniques or Countermeasures (see
<em>Section 3.3: Reviewing Added Techniques and Countermeasures</em> for
more information on the review process).</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="importing-an-existing-playbook" class="level3">
<h3>2.3 Importing an Existing Playbook</h3>
<p>Updating and making revisions to Playbooks is an important part of
their lifecycle. Playbook-NG supports this process by allowing
previously-created Playbooks to be imported for editing. To import an
existing Playbook, click on the “<strong>Import Existing</strong>”
button on the home page, which will bring up an “open file” dialog that
allows for the selection of a previously exported Playbook-NG JSON
file.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/5_import_existing.jpg" style="width:280px;border: 3px solid #555" alt="The Import Button (home page)"><br/><b>Figure
5: Importing Existing Playbook Button</b>
</p>
<section id="import-playbook" class="level4">
<h4>2.3.1 Import Playbook</h4>
<p>After importing a Playbook-NG JSON file, users are presented with the
Import Playbook page. This page (see <strong>Figure 6</strong>, below)
updates, and then displays, the contents of the Playbook to be
imported.</p>
<p>The Playbook update process works as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Unknown / deprecated Techniques are removed</li>
<li>Revoked Techniques are replaced</li>
<li>Unknown Countermeasures are removed</li>
<li>Outdated Countermeasures are updated to their new versions present
in the app</li>
<li>New Countermeasure mappings for the Techniques are added (<em>if
such Countermeasures were not ignored</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the below example, there are no automatic updates to be made since
each item (Technique or Countermeasure) is marked as “unchanged”.
Therefore, the example Playbook will be imported as-is.</p>
<p>To finish the import process, click on the “<strong>Import</strong>”
button in the bottom left-hand corner of the page.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/6_import_review.jpg" style="width:600px;border: 3px solid #555" alt="The import Playbook review page"><br/><b>Figure
6: Import Playbook Review Page</b>
</p>
<p>Should the “<strong>Cancel</strong>” button in the bottom-left corner
be pressed, the page will revert to a view allowing selection of a
different Playbook JSON file.</p>

<h3>3.1 Adding ATT&amp;CK Techniques to a Playbook</h3>
<p>The Add Techniques page allows users to browse and add ATT&amp;CK
techniques to their Playbook.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/8_add_techniques_overview.jpg" style="width:600px;border: 3px solid #555" alt="Add Techniques Page"><br/><b>Figure
8: Add Techniques Page</b>
</p>
<p>Playbook-NG incorporates the full set of Techniques and
Sub-Techniques from the latest ATT&amp;CK Enterprise release, any of
which may be included in a Playbook. Future releases of Playbook-NG may
include Techniques and Sub-techniques from other ATT&amp;CK domains (for
example, Mobile or ICS) if Countermeasures mapped to these domains are
available.</p>
<p>To help minimize the size of the Add ATT&amp;CK Techniques page,
Playbook-NG presents ATT&amp;CK Techniques as “cards” with just the
first line of description text. To view the full details of a Technique,
including the description, associated Tactics, and references, click on
the <strong>More Info</strong> link below the description text (see
<strong>Figure 8</strong>, above) on the card. This will bring up an
info box that contains the full set of information.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/9_expanded_technique.jpg" style="width:600px;border: 3px solid #555" alt="An example expanded ATT&CK technique (Add Techniques page)"><br/><b>Figure
9: Expanded Technique Info Box (example)</b>
</p>
<p>Both the Technique card and the Technique info box include a
<strong>View on ATT&amp;CK</strong> link (see <strong>Figures 8 and
9</strong>, above) in the top-right corner that navigates to the
corresponding Technique page on the official ATT&amp;CK website.</p>
<p>Adding a Technique to a Playbook is simple - use the <strong>+Add To
Playbook</strong> button (see <strong>Figures 8 and 9</strong>, above).
To add a Sub-Technique, add it directly using the same method, or select
it inside of the parent Technique’s info box and then similarly use
<strong>+Add To Playbook</strong> in the top right corner.</p>
<p>Any Techniques or Sub-Techniques that are added will immediately show
up in the <strong>Playbook Cart</strong> to the right of the Techniques
List (see <strong>Figure 10</strong>, below). For more information on
the cart and how to use it, refer to <em>Section 3.1.4: Cart
Overview</em> below.</p>

</p>
<section id="searching-for-techniques" class="level4">
<h4>3.1.1 Searching for Techniques</h4>
<p>The primary way of finding Techniques to add to a Playbook is through
the search bar (see <strong>Figure 11</strong>, below). The search bar
allows searching by an ATT&amp;CK Technique’s ID/Name (if known), as
well as any key words that may be associated with a Technique (e.g.,
“UAC”). The returned search results will include any ATT&amp;CK
Techniques, including Sub-Techniques, which matched the search
query.</p>

</section>
<section id="technique-filters" class="level4">
<h4>3.1.2 Technique Filters</h4>
<p>Technique filters allow for refining the set of presented Techniques
to a smaller, more manageable set.</p>
<p>To use the filters, expose the filtering drop-down menu by clicking
on <strong>Show Filters &gt;</strong> (directly below the text search
bar). Once exposed, the drop-down menu will reveal 4 types of
filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain</li>
<li>Platform</li>
<li>Tactic</li>
<li>Data Source</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/13_shown_filters.jpg" style="width:600px;border: 3px solid #555" alt="Technique Filters"><br/><b>Figure
13: Technique Filters</b>
</p>
<p>Filters operate in the following manner with respect to returned
results:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Checking multiple options within a single filter (e.g., Platforms)
is a union operation which returns more results.</li>
<li>Using multiple filters (e.g., Platforms and Data Sources) is an
intersection operation on their combined matches and returns less
results.</li>
</ol>
<p>Individual filters may be cleared-out by manually unchecking filter
selections. To clear all filter selections, click on the <strong>Clear
All Filters</strong> button above the filters. To close any of the
individual filter selections (e.g., Platforms), simply click outside of
the filter.</p>
<section id="filter-numbers" class="level5">
<h5>3.1.2.1 Filter Numbers</h5>
<p>The top of each filter includes numbers next to its name, which
indicate:</p>
<ol type="1">

<h5>3.1.2.4 Tactics Filter</h5>
<p>The Tactics filter (see <strong>Figure 15</strong>, below) displays
the set of ATT&amp;CK Tactics that Techniques are mapped to. In
ATT&amp;CK, Tactics represent the “why” of an ATT&amp;CK Technique or
Sub-Technique and the adversary’s tactical goal (the reason for
performing an action). Some Techniques can be used to achieve multiple
goals, and therefore are mapped to multiple Tactics.</p>
<p>Users can make use of the Tactics filter to select the set of Tactics
that are relevant to their Playbook. For example, if one is trying to
select Countermeasures only for Techniques that are trying to achieve
Persistence, the “Persistence” value in the Tactics filter can be
selected.</p>

<h5>3.1.2.5 Data Sources Filter</h5>
<p>The Data Sources filter (see <strong>Figure 16</strong>, below)

to. In ATT&amp;CK, data sources refer to the types of data that may be
collected on a host or network to potentially detect an ATT&amp;CK
Technique or Sub-Technique. Therefore, data sources are most relevant to
threat hunting and analytics.</p>
<p>For example, the “Process Creation” data source can be used to detect
T1569.002 System Services: Service Execution, by providing the data
around newly executed processes that call out to the Windows service
control manager. Therefore, users can filter Techniques by data sources
that may be available in their environment (e.g., those that are
collected by a tool) or are otherwise appropriate for their particular
use.</p>

<h4>3.1.3 Adding Techniques with the Technique ID Extractor</h4>
<p>Playbook-NG supports adding Techniques extracted from free text
through the Technique ID Extractor tool. The Technique ID Extractor tool
is found near the top of the Add Techniques page, under “Add Techniques
from Text” and can be opened by clicking on the “<strong>&gt;</strong>”
to the right of its name.</p>
<p>Once opened (see <strong>Figure 17</strong>, below), the tool
presents a text box (under “Paste Text Here”), where any free-form text
can be entered and any ATT&amp;CK Technique or Sub-Technique IDs present
in the text will be extracted for possible inclusion in the Playbook.
Extraction of IDs happens automatically once text is entered into the
text box.</p>
<p align="center">

17: ATT&amp;CK Technique ID Extractor (with sample text)</b>
</p>
<p>Once the available Techniques or Sub-technique IDs have been
extracted, the last step in using the Technique ID Extractor is
selecting the extracted Techniques to add to the Playbook (see
<strong>Figure 18</strong>, below). To add one or more extracted
Techniques, simply click on the check box to the left of the Technique
to select it, and then click on the “<strong>Add Selected</strong>”
button in the bottom right-hand corner.</p>
<p>Similarly, all of the extracted Techniques can be selected using the
“<strong>Select All</strong>” button, and deselected with the
“<strong>Select None</strong>” button, both of which are found under the
list of extracted Techniques (see <strong>Figure 18</strong>, below). As
with manually added Techniques, any extracted Techniques that are added
will show up in the Playbook Cart, and those that have already been
added (and are in the cart) will be listed as such in the Technique ID
Extractor (see <strong>Figure 19</strong>, below).</p>

<h4>3.1.4 Cart Overview</h4>
<p>The Playbook-NG cart functions much like a traditional e-commerce
shopping cart and provides a summary of the selected Playbook Techniques
and Countermeasures.</p>
<p>There are two ways to interact with cart items - clicking on the
information icon (“<strong>i</strong>”) will bring up an info box that
contains the full details of a particular Technique or Countermeasure;
the same can be achieved by clicking on <strong>More Info..</strong>
when viewing a Technique or Countermeasure. Similarly, clicking on the
trashcan icon (🗑️) will delete an item from the cart.</p>

are those that are deemed to be useful in many scenarios; however, they
can be manually deleted by clicking on the trashcan icon (🗑️) next to

<h3>3.2 Adding Countermeasures to a Playbook</h3>
<p>The process of adding Countermeasures in Playbook-NG is largely
automated, since the Countermeasures that are applicable for a
particular ATT&amp;CK Technique are automatically added once that
Technique has been added to a Playbook. For example, the following
Countermeasures are automatically added for <strong>T1003: OS Credential
Dumping</strong>.</p>

<h4>3.2.1 Additional Countermeasures</h4>
<p>Playbook-NG also supports the manual addition of Countermeasures,
outside of those mapped to ATT&amp;CK Techniques. The Additional
Countermeasures page which supports the manual addition of
Countermeasures can be accessed by clicking on the <strong>&gt;
Countermeasures</strong> button on the top right corner of the cart
while on the Techniques page. Besides adding individual Countermeasures,
the Countermeasures page also allows users to explore the set of
Countermeasures that are available in Playbook-NG.</p>

<p>The interface for the Countermeasures page is very similar to that
used for the Techniques page - the one difference is that there are no
individual filters for Countermeasures, with the free-text search bar
being the only search interface. Therefore, any free-form text can be
used to find any additional Countermeasures. Any matching text for the
free-text search is displayed in the <strong>Matches:</strong> section
found at the bottom of each Countermeasure (see <strong>Figure
24</strong>, below).</p>

<h3>4.1 Exporting a Playbook</h3>
<p>Once the review of a Playbook is complete, the final step is to
export it in the desired format. Before exporting, it is recommended
that the Playbook title is changed from its default value of
